The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. The project is a breading ground for many different mobile security projects within OWASP. Right now, you can find the following active OWASP mobile security projects:
