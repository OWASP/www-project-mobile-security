# Mobile Security Project Web Page Repo

This is the repo for https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security/. It is maintained by multiple people at the moment, but no owner has been assigned.

## Changes
Want to change the page? Follow the same steps as with the MSTG repo: fork this project, apply changes to your own fork and then create a PR. The process is similar to contributing to the [MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

## Report an issue
Want to report an issue with the content or how it is displayed? File an [issue](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-mobile-security/issues). **Please note that this project is only about having the proper links and guidance towards other mobile related projects. It is not responsible for the content of the other project pages. For this, you have to look for the leader of that specific project.**

## Communication
Currently most of the communication can best be done via OWASP Slack. See [the MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) on how ot get there. Please understand that OWASP has a global code of conduct to adhere to, which is similar as the one used by the [MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
